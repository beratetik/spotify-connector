# Spotify Connector

## Setup
`> npm install spotify-connector`

## Usage
You just pass the necessary parameters to the object that you created out of the class and call `connect()`. That's it. 

It's not magic.
<br/><br/>
But here's the more detailed version of the usage:
 ```
 import SpotifyConnector from "spotify-connector"

 const spotifyConnector = new SpotifyConnector({
     clientID: "<SPOTIFY_DEV_CLIENT_ID>"
     clientSecret: "<SPOTIFY_DEV_CLIENT_SECRET>"
     redirectURI: "<SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI>"
     authorizationScopes: "<[AUTHORIZATION_SCOPES]>" // optional - (default:null) 
 });

 spotifyConnector.connect(); 
 ```
 
After the redirection you need to parse and get the token from the URL generated by Spotify and use it to make requests you want
